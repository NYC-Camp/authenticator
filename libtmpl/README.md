libtmpl
=======
libtmpl is a small templating utility that assists with the structuring of
templates. It uses a base template doesn't contain anything except the overall
html structure. There is also a head template for everything in the head tags,
and finally header, footer, and content templates.
Look at the ../templates folder for an example implementation.
